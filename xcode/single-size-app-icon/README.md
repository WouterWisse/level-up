### Xcode - Single size app icon
Xcode 14 introduced a way to create your app icon with just one `1024x1024` image. Just select `Single Size` in the attributes panel of your `AppIcon` file.<br /><br />

Note: For me it only worked when my Asset Catalog containing my iconset was placed in the root of my project. I had it in `Resources/â€¦` before, but that resulted in validation errors when uploading the app to the AppStore. Also make sure the image does not contain an alpha layer.
