### Xcode - Localize an app's display name
You can localize your app name by creating an `InfoPlist.strings` file.<br />
You should enable localization on that file just like every other strings file you'd like to localize.<br />
Add `"CFBundleDisplayName" = "<MyAppName>";` to your `InfoPlist.strings` files and your app's name is automagically ðŸª„ localized.
